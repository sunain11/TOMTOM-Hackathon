<p><b>Service management and improvement</b></p>
<p>TomTom keeps information that tells us how and when you use our services. This includes information about the device you are using and the information we receive while you use the service, such as locations, routes, destinations and search queries. TomTom is unable to identify you based on the information it collects, and will not try to. TomTom uses the information for technical diagnostics, to detect fraud and abuse, to create usage reports, and to improve its services. The information is kept only for these purposes and for a limited period of time, after which it is destroyed. TomTom applies security methods based on industry standards to protect the information against unauthorised access.</p>
